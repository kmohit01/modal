                Libraries serve as community gathering places where people can come together to learn, collaborate, and socialize. Many libraries offer meeting rooms, study areas, and designated spaces for group activities or quiet reading.
                Public libraries are fantastic resources! They often offer a wide range of books, magazines, newspapers, audiobooks, and sometimes even movies and music CDs for borrowing. Many public libraries also provide access to computers and the internet, as well as various programs and events for the community.
